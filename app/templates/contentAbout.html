		MovSim is a
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car-following_model">microscopic</a>
		road traffic simulator. The simulator implements various
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car-following_model">car-following models</a>
		of different model categories like time-continuous models, iterated maps and cellular automata. Recently, we added a microscopic model for cross-country skiing. Lane changes are modeled with the general MOBIL strategy based on accelerations.

	<h3>Reasons for developing traffic models:</h3>
	<ul class="reasons">

		<li>To simulate the effect of control measures like</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Speed limits</li>
			<li>Variable message signs like routing.</li>
			<li>
				Overtaking bans for trucks, especially at uphill or downhill sections
			</li>
			<li>
				Restrictions for lane changing, especially before or at merging
			</li>
			regions
			<li>Traffic flow control at on ramps</ul>

			<li>To simulate the effect of new infrastructure before</li>
			it has been build.
			<li>
				To simulate the influence of vehicles with adaptive 
cruise-control systems. If an increasing precentage of vehicles has
such systems, does traffic become more stable? Can 
the traffic flow per lane be increased?
			</li>
			<li>
				Finally even simulations of different or new traffic rules are possible.
For example, allowing overtaking on freeways at either side combined
with a speed limit, ...
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>
			In summary, traffic simulation can contribute to a reduction of traffic
    congestions <em>without</em>
			building new infrastructure!
		</h3>

		<p>
			MovSim is intended as a tool for model investigation and comparison. Our goal is to model and simulate all basic traffic situations and discrete decision like lane changes, reacting to a traffic light, yielding and overtaking on rural roads in a generic way and therefore applicable to the implemented models.

		<p>
			MovSim can be run from commandline or with a graphical user interface including visualization. Several output quantities can be written to file for further analysis. MovSim also provides a physics-based fuel-consumption model to calculate consumption on an individual or collective level.
